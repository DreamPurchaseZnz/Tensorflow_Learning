# What's the difference between deep copy and shallow copy
## Shallow copy
The variables A and B refer to different areas of memory, 
when B is assigned to A the two variables refer to the same area of memory. 
Later modifications to the contents of either are instantly reflected in the contents of other, as they share contents.
